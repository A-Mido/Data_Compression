## Project Description <a name="description"></a>

For this project, I'm interestesting in implementing Huffman Coding for files compression.

To anybody who does not know about Data compression:
Data compression is a very crucial concept which is used to get the most benefit of any network or a storage resourses it's the core of well-known software like winrar and at the large scale any tech gaint who deals with a big data like Amazon, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, ... all the social media
must deal with this concept and if they don't they will lose billions of dollars.

Huffman Coding is one of the well-known data compression techniques it's a lossless compression that means you can compress the file size without lossing any of the data after decompressing prosedure. for more [info] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

I will implement Huffman Coding using python firstly and then i will implement using C++.

Once I finish any implementation i will presen the file structure

Huffman Coding using python:

Must give credit to [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCOph23TQTY&feature=youtu.be) for the great effort in the python code it gives me a great information.
